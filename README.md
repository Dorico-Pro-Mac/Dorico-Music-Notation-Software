Dorico is a professional music notation program that sets a new standard in scoring technology. Created by a team of experts at Steinberg, it combines a sleek, modern interface with deeply innovative features tailored for today’s composers and arrangers. Unlike traditional notation software, Dorico is designed from the ground up to be both powerful and accessible, helping you focus on your creativity rather than software limitations.

At the heart of Dorico is its revolutionary approach to music layout. The software intelligently handles spacing, collisions, and formatting, allowing you to produce publication-quality scores with minimal manual adjustment. Its unique modal workflow guides you logically through the stages of composition—from setting up your ensemble and writing music to fine-tuning engraving details and finally printing or exporting the result.

Key features include the Fluid Music Input system for fast and intuitive note entry, the Harmonic Grid for exploring chord progressions, and integrated VST support for rich, dynamic playback. Dorico also offers robust support for MusicXML, making it easy to collaborate with users of other notation programs.

Whether you are working on a symphony, a jazz chart, or a lead sheet, Dorico provides the tools you need to bring your musical ideas to life with clarity and elegance. It is trusted by educators, professional composers, and music publishers around the world for its reliability and outstanding output quality.
